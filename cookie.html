              checking this page regularly for any updates to stay informed
              about our privacy practices. Continued use of the website after
              such updates implies your acceptance of these changes. If you
              disagree, your only option is to stop using the site. Our Cookie
              Policy is part of our overall Privacy Policy and includes the

            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>What Are Cookies?</strong> Cookies are small text files
                that are placed on your device to improve user experience,
                provide personalized content, and track site usage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Types of Cookies:</strong> We use two main types of
                cookies: session cookies (temporary) that expire once you leave
                the site, and persistent cookies that remain until their set
                expiration date or until deleted by the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cookies from Third Parties:</strong> Third-party
                organizations may place cookies for various reasons, including
                analytics, advertising, and functionality. These cookies collect
                data that may be used to build a profile of your preferences
                across websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cookie Preferences:</strong> You have the option to
                manage or disable cookies directly in your browser settings.
                Keep in mind that disabling cookies may affect the functionality
                of certain site features.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Cookie Use:</strong> Some third-party
                advertisers may use cookies to tailor ads to your interests,
                measure ad performance, or track user behavior across websites.
                We do not control the content or behavior of third-party
                cookies.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Additionally, we may employ technologies such as web beacons,
              pixel tags, and clear GIFs to track user activity. These
              technologies work in conjunction with cookies to monitor website
              usage. While you can limit their use by managing cookies, there’s
              no direct method for opting out of these tracking technologies.
            </p>

            <h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              Our website, along with third-party vendors, may use cookies for
              interest-based advertising, which helps provide relevant ads
              across various devices. While we strive to manage cookies
              effectively, we do not have full control over third-party cookies.
              We are not responsible for any actions taken by these third-party
              vendors.
            </p>

            <h3>Advertising Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              Our website evaluates and ranks service providers based on
              performance, reliability, and customer support. We may earn
              commissions from referral fees, advertisements, and sponsorships.
              These rankings are independent but based on thorough research and
              testing. Always check individual service websites for the most
              accurate information.
